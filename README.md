# Hi there, I'm Gyuvin Kim 👋

I'm a software engineer currently based in Montreal. I thrive on building cool things with code, from **building efficient design tools for digital marketing** to exploring the intricate connections between brain morphology and genetics.
When I'm not coding, I'm probably in a movie theater or planning my next adventure. So far, I've backpacked through **33 countries and 99 cities**.

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

* Right now, I'm currently working as a **Software Engineer at Hubble**.
* I recently joined the team, ready to build cool things.

### 💻 My Tech Stack

I'm comfortable working across the stack, but my main tools are:

* **Front-End:** React, TypeScript, Next.js, MUI (Material-UI)
* **Data Analysis:** Python, PyTorch
* **Competitive Programming:** C++, You can find me on [solved.ac/BOJ](https://solved.ac/en/profile/4hn6) (top 0.59%) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/westfield).

### ⏪ A Look Back

* **Research Intern at Polytechnique Montréal:** Engineered a robust alignment solution for 3D brain morphology analysis to fix critical pipeline failures and generate a "BrainTree".
* **Software Engineer at NGINE STUDIOS, NEXON:**
    * Engineered the front-end for **ADCreator**, an in-house design tool that enabled users to create high-quality, multi-size ad banners, significantly accelerating the marketing creative workflow.
    * Designed and implemented a novel sentence distortion algorithm for **MapleStory's** anti-botting system to enhance fair play for millions of users.
    * Contributed to the **Nexon Youth Programming Challenge (NYPC)** by testing algorithmic problems and defining platform requirements.
