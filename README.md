# Hi there, I'm Gyuvin Kim 👋

I'm a software engineer currently based in Montreal. My journey has taken me from building efficient design tools for digital marketing to exploring the connection between brain morphology and genetics. Currently, I'm channeling that experience into building a powerful UX research tool at Hubble.  
When I'm not coding, I'm probably in a movie theater or planning my next adventure. So far, I've backpacked through **33 countries and 99 cities**.

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

* Right now, I'm currently working as a **Software Engineer at Hubble**.
* Developing features for our **[UX research platform](https://www.usehubble.io/)** to help teams understand their users better.

### 💻 My Tech Stack

I'm comfortable working across the stack, but my main tools are:

* **Front-End:** React, TypeScript, Next.js, MUI (Material-UI)
* **Data Analysis:** Python, PyTorch
* **Competitive Programming:** C++, You can find me on [solved.ac/BOJ](https://solved.ac/en/profile/4hn6) (top 0.59%) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/westfield).

### ⏪ A Look Back

* **Research Intern at Polytechnique Montréal:** Engineered a robust alignment solution for 3D brain morphology analysis to fix critical pipeline failures and generate a "BrainTree".
* **Software Engineer at NGINE STUDIOS, NEXON:**
    * Engineered the front-end for **ADCreator**, an in-house design tool that enabled users to create high-quality, multi-size ad banners, significantly accelerating the marketing creative workflow.
    * Designed and implemented a novel sentence distortion algorithm for **MapleStory's** anti-botting system to enhance fair play for millions of users.
    * Contributed to the **Nexon Youth Programming Challenge (NYPC)** by testing algorithmic problems and defining platform requirements.
