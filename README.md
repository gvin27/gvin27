# Hi there, I'm Gyuvin Kim 👋

I'm a software engineer and researcher currently based in Montreal. I thrive on building cool things with code, from enhancing gameplay for millions to exploring the intricate connections between brain morphology and genetics.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably in a movie theater or planning my next adventure. So far, I've backpacked through **33 countries and 99 cities**.

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

* Right now, I'm a **Research Intern at Polytechnique Montréal**.
* I'm performing computational shape analysis on 3D neuroimaging data to investigate the relationship between brain morphology and genetics.

### 💻 My Tech Stack

I'm comfortable working across the stack, but my main tools are:

* **Front-End:** React, TypeScript, MUI (Material-UI)
* **AI:** Python, PyTorch
* **Competitive Programming:** C++, You can find me on [solved.ac/BOJ](https://solved.ac/en/profile/4hn6) (top 0.59%) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/westfield).

### ⏪ A Look Back

* I was previously a **Software Engineer at NGINE STUDIOS, NEXON** in Seoul.
* I engineered the front-end for **ADCreator**, an in-house design tool that enabled users to create high-quality, multi-size ad banners with a few clicks.
* I also designed and implemented a novel sentence distortion algorithm for the online game **MapleStory's** anti-botting system to enhance fair play.
